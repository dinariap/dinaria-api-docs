# Guides

Guides explain how to use the Payments API in real-world scenarios.

They cover recommended integration flows, lifecycle concepts, and best practices
for building reliable, secure, and production-ready payment integrations.

Use the API Reference for endpoint details, and the Guides to understand when,
why, and how to use them correctly.

## Environments
Start with `Getting Started` to choose the correct base URL and API key for
sandbox vs dev/test/prod.

## Step-by-step example
See `Step-by-Step Payment Example` for a full merchant flow with curl commands.

## Merchant tools
See `Merchant Tools & Admin Pages (Sandbox)` for merchant-facing admin tools and URLs.
