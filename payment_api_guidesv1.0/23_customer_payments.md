## Notes

- Only payments where `customer_id` matches the given customer are returned.
- A customer may have payments across multiple merchants — all are included.
- Use `status=confirmed` to see only successfully completed cash-ins.
- For balance impact, only `confirmed` payments credit the customer's virtual account.
