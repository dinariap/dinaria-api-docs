# Payment API — Brazil (PIX)

Welcome to the Dinaria API documentation for Brazil.

This portal contains guides and references to help you integrate PIX payments quickly and safely.

## What you can do with this API

- Create payments using PIX (instant, 24/7)

## PIX keys

Recipients (and sometimes payers) are identified by a PIX key. Supported types:

| Email   | `user@example.com`   |
| Phone   | `+5511999999999`     |
| Random  | Alphanumeric key     |

## Key identifiers
