### Fields

| Field | Description |
|-------|-------------|
| `available` | Funds the customer can use for PIX payouts right now. |
| `pending` | Funds tied to unconfirmed PIX cash-ins or in-flight payouts. |
| `reserved` | Funds reserved for other purposes (e.g. holds). |
| `updatedAt` | Timestamp of the last balance recalculation. |

---

## Balance lifecycle

| Event | Effect on `available` |
|-------|-----------------------|
| PIX transfer confirmed | ➕ Increases |
| Payout created (`pending`) | ➖ Decreases (reserved) |
| Payout completed | No change (already deducted at creation) |
| Payout permanently failed | ➕ Returns the reserved amount |

PIX is near-instant — `pending` balance typically clears within seconds.
