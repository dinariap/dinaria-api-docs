## Notes

- Only payouts where `customer_id` matches the given customer are returned.
- A customer may have payouts across multiple merchants — all are included.
- To send a new payout to this customer, use [`POST /payouts`](create-a-payout) with `customerId`.
- PIX payouts typically complete within seconds — `completedAt` is usually within 2–3 seconds of `submittedAt`.
